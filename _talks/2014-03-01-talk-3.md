Recent advances in integrated circuit technology have produced highly integrated mixed-signal modules that include data acquisition, processing, storage, and wireless connectivity. Such System-on-Chip (SoC) modules are commercially available for a wide range of low power and portable applications, including industrial, consumer electronics, toys and gaming, renewable energy, sports and fitness, and medical applications. High performance analog and digital peripherals, multiple low power modes, and multiple transmission modes, make these modules customizable for various applications. Such modules could also provide low power and portability features to Doppler radar physiological sensors. In this paper we discuss advantages of using SoC's for Doppler radar physiological sensing, and compare performance of SoC transmission modes.
