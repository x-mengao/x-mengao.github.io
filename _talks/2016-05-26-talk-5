This paper presents a novel method of using AC coupled quadrature Doppler radar for gesture classification. A barcode is generated based on time-domain zero-crossing characteristics of quadrature components in reflected signals of hand gesture. Each motion is repeated within 60 seconds to create a distinguishable pattern on a barcode plot, which can be used for differentiation of motion types and gesture classification.
