A heterodyne and a homodyne quadrature radar receiving systems were used to detect small scale tag motion and non-tagged motion from a distance, respectively. Arctangent demodulation algorithm and imbalance compensation technique were applied to the raw radar data for displacement estimation. Simulation and experimental results were compared, indicating that by using the frequency doubling tag, a better accuracy can be achieved for small displacement estimation with Doppler radar.
